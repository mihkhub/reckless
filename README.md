Introduction
============
Reckless is an [extremely low-latency, high-throughput logging
library](doc/performance.md). It was created because I needed to perform
extensive diagnostic logging without worrying about performance. [Other
logging libraries](http://www.pantheios.org/performance.html) boast the
ability to throw log messages away very quickly. Reckless boasts the ability
to keep them all, without worrying about the performance impact. Filtering can
and should wait until you want to read the log, or need to clean up disk
space.

How it works
============
By low latency I mean that the time from calling the library and returning
to the caller is as short as I could make it. The code generated at the
call site consists of

1. Pushing the arguments on a thread-local queue. This has the same cost
   as pushing the arguments on the stack for a normal function call.
2. Call to Boost.Lockless (NB: this is bundled with the library, not an
   external dependency) to register the write request on a shared
   lockless queue.

The actual message formatting and writing is performed asynchronously by a
separate thread. This removes or hides several costs:

* No transition to the kernel at the call site. The kernel is an easily
  overlooked but important cost, not only because the transition costs
  time, but because it pollutes the CPU cache. In other words, avoiding
  this *makes your non-logging code run faster* than if you were using a
  library that has to enter the kernel to perform its work.
* No locks need to be taken for synchronization between threads (unless
  the queue fills up; see the performance article for more information
  about the implications of this).
* It doesn't have to wait for the actual I/O operation to complete.
* If there are bursts of log calls, multiple items on the queue can be
  batched into a single I/O operation, improving throughput without sacrificing
  write latency.

For a more detailed performance discussion and statistics, see the
[performance article](doc/performance.md).

What's the catch?
=================
As all string formatting and I/O is done asynchronously and in a single
thread, there are a few caveats you need to be aware of:
* If you choose to pass log arguments by reference or pointer, then you
  must ensure that the referenced data remains valid at least until the
  log has been flushed or closed (unless you're only interested in
  logging the value of the pointer itself). The best option for
  dynamically allocated data is typically `std::string`,
  `std::shared_ptr` or `std::unique_ptr`.
* You must take special care to handle crashes if you want to make sure
  that all log data prior to the crash is saved. This is not unique to
  asynchronous logging&mdash;for example fprintf will buffer data until you
  flush it&mdash;but asynchronous logging arguably makes the issue worse. The
  library provides convenience functions to aid with this.
* As all string formatting is done in a single thread, it could theoretically
  limit the scalability of your application if the formatting is very
  expensive.
* Performance becomes somewhat less predictable and harder to measure. Rather
  than putting the cost of the logging on the thread that calls the logging
  library, the OS may suspend some other thread to make room for the logging
  thread to run.

Basic use
=========
```c++
#include <reckless/severity_log.hpp>
#include <reckless/file_writer.hpp>

// It is possible to build custom loggers for various ways of formatting the
// log. The severity log is a stock policy-based logger that allows you to
// configure fields that should be put on each line, including a severity
// marker for debug/info/warning/error.
using log_t = reckless::severity_log<
    reckless::indent<4>,       // 4 spaces of indent
    ' ',                       // Field separator
    reckless::severity_field,  // Show severity marker (D/I/W/E) first
    reckless::timestamp_field  // Then timestamp field
    >;

reckless::file_writer writer("log.txt");
log_t g_log(&writer);

int main()
{
    std::string s("Hello World!");

    // You can use ordinary printf-style syntax, but unlike stdio this
    // is type-safe and extensible.
    g_log.debug("Pointer: %p", s.c_str());
    g_log.info("Info line: %s", s);

    for(int i=0; i!=4; ++i) {
        reckless::scoped_indent indent;  // The indent object causes the lines
        g_log.warn("Warning: %d", i);    // within this scope to be indented.
    }

    g_log.error("Error: %f", 3.14);

    return 0;
}
```
This would give the following output:
```
D 2015-03-29 13:23:35.288  Pointer: 0x1e18218
I 2015-03-29 13:23:35.288  Info line: Hello World!
W 2015-03-29 13:23:35.288      Warning: 0
W 2015-03-29 13:23:35.288      Warning: 1
W 2015-03-29 13:23:35.288      Warning: 2
W 2015-03-29 13:23:35.288      Warning: 3
E 2015-03-29 13:23:35.288  Error: 3.140000
```

Platforms
=========
The library currently works only on Linux. Windows and BSD are on the roadmap.
I don't own any Apple computers, so OS X won't happen unless someone sends me
a patch or buys me hardware.

Building
========
To build the library, clone the git repository and run make.

To build a program against the library, given the variable RECKLESS
pointing to the reckless root directory, use:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 myprogram.cpp -I${RECKLESS}/boost -I${RECKLESS}/reckless/include -L${RECKLESS}/reckless/lib -lreckless -lpthread
```

================

Alternatives
============
Two other logging libraries with a similar, asynchronous design are
[spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/) and
[g2log](https://bitbucket.org/KjellKod/g2log/).
